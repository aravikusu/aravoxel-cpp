# aravoxel
aravoxel is a voxel engine written in C++ using GLFW and OpenGL.

The idea is that oneday it will be an ActionRPG inspired by Cube World.
It's not there yet.
Not even close.

Incredibly early. Doesn't do anything yet.

## Requirements
You'll need GLFW installed.

Building is only tested on Linux. I'd imagine the setup won't work elsewhere.
Might fix someday.
